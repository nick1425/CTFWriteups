## 7110

### The Challenge

Santa is stranded on the Christmas Islands and is desperately trying to reach his trusty companion via cellphone. We've bugged the device with a primitive keylogger and have been able to decode some of the SMS, but couldn't make much sense of the last one. Can you give us a hand?

### The Solution

We wrote a [program](https://github.com/nickbhe/CTFWriteups/tree/master/ctfs/2019/overthewire_advent) to translate the logs of the Nokia N7110.
